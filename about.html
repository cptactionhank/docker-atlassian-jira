      Found a problem with one of the Atlassian JIRA images? Feel free to open a ticket on the {{site.repo.github}} repository on <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/issues">GitHub</a>, but you should keep a few things in mind:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Use the <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/search?q=&type=Issues">GitHub issue search
        </a> to check if your issue has already been reported.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to isolate your problem as much as possible, so we can easily test if
        the issue has been fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you are sure the issue is with Select2, and not a third party
        library,
        <a href="https://github.com/{{site.author.github}}/{{site.repo.github}}/issues/new">
          submit a ticket
        </a>
        to the repository.
      </li>
    </ol>
